A note about SamplePlugin.uml.

Enki's primary client, Farrago, uses model plugins.  Model plugins are
UML models that import the Farrago UML metamodel, and then provide
additional packages, classes, associations, etc.  At build time, the
plugin model and main model are stitched together to form a single,
complete UML file, which is then converted into Java classes,
excluding the main model's classes.

SamplePlugin.uml is a simplified test case for this procedure.  Keep
all plugin classes in the Plugin package.  You may add references to
PluginBaseRef package classes as necessary.  Don't try to extend other
classes in the EEM model unless you want to debug the XSL transforms.

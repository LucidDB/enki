A note about SamplePlugin.uml.

Enki's primary client, Farrago, uses model plugins.  Model plugins are
UML models that import the Farrago UML metamodel, and then provide
additional packages, classes, associations, etc.  At build time, the
plugin model and main model are stitched together to form a single,
complete UML file, which is then converted into Java classes,
excluding the main model's classes.

SamplePlugin.uml is a simplified test case for this procedure.  It
started as a complete copy of Sample.uml, but they may have diverged
since then.  To keep tests functioning properly, the pluginbase
package in both files must match and the plugin package specified in
SamplePlugin.uml must only reference element described in pluginbase.

Therefore, if you modify elements in pluginbase, you must modify them
in both files.  Elements in other packages are always taken from
Sample.uml and need only be modified in that file.

Ultimately, the intention is to move Farrago's model manipulation code
entirely into Enki, at which time it should be possible to modify
SamplePlugin.uml to contain only the plugin package and remove the
double-modification rules.
